# Export the intended (vs. as-built) conda environments as fully versioned
# (frozen) environment specifications.  These specs often require tweaking
# despite their origin from successfully built systems.  These specs originate
# inside a fully built container but become specs for frozen environments in
# the Docker source tree.  Nominally this is run when USE_FROZEN=0 and an
# environment is being resolved from loosely specified version requirements.
